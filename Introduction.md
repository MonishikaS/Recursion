Recursion in programming refers to a technique where a function calls itself in order to solve a problem. Recursive functions are particularly useful for solving problems 
that can be broken down into smaller, similar subproblems. Here's how recursion works in C:

1. **Base Case:** A recursive function always needs a base case that defines when the recursion should stop. This is the simplest form of the problem that can be solved
2. directly without further recursion.

3. **Recursive Case:** The function calls itself with modified arguments to break down the problem into smaller subproblems. The goal is to eventually reach the base case.

When using recursion, it's important to ensure that the problem is broken down into smaller instances in each recursive call, leading towards the base case. 
Without this, the recursion might lead to infinite loops.

Here's a classic example of a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a non-negative integer:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int factorial(int n) {
    // Base case
    if (n == 0 || n == 1) {
        return 1;
    }
    // Recursive case
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
}

int main() {
    int num = 5;
    printf("Factorial of %d is %d\n", num, factorial(num));
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `factorial` function calculates the factorial of a number using recursion. It breaks down the problem into smaller subproblems 
(factorials of smaller numbers) until it reaches the base case of `n` being 0 or 1.

Recursion can be an elegant solution for certain problems, but it comes with some considerations:

- **Memory Usage:** Recursive functions create new stack frames for each call, which consumes memory. Deep recursion might lead to a stack overflow.
- Some languages and compilers offer optimizations like tail recursion to mitigate this.

- **Performance:** Recursive functions can be less efficient than iterative solutions due to the overhead of function calls.

- **Debugging:** Recursive functions can be harder to debug compared to iterative solutions.

- **Base Case and Convergence:** Ensuring that the base case is reached and that the recursion converges towards it is crucial to avoid infinite recursion.

It's important to use recursion when it makes the code more readable and maintainable. In some cases, an iterative approach might be a better choice for performance 
reasons or to avoid the potential pitfalls of recursion.
